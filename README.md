# Car-Price-Prediction
- In this project, I have predicted car price.
- I have included both frontend and backend.
- In backend, I have first cleaned the data. Then, I have used OneHotEncoder for model creation, as a result I got "LinearRegressionModel.pkl" file.
- These both files are used in frontend.
- app.py is the main file.
